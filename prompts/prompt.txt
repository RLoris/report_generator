You are a project manager reviewing a raw Perforce (P4) version control report from a developer.
Analyze the following developer report and extract the necessary information to create a professional and concise report in markdown for release notes.
No need to summarize anything, only format this raw report in a more readable one without adding or removing crucial information or inventing anything.
Only extract the title, description and #jira tickets if any. You can discard the changelist id, workspace, date, status and all the other tags starting with #. 
The report must merge pending and submitted changes together, pending and submitted changes need to appear in the report, nothing must be lost.
Add a counter next to each changelist title, this is to make sure that the total count matches the pending + submitted amount, and no data is lost.
Don't add anything else, no headers or subtitles or footer.

This is how each changelist is listed : 

Change ID on DATE by CLIENT

	Title of the change
	- Description line 1
	- Description line 2
    ...
	#jira UE-123456, UE-654321
	#tag1 value
    	#tag2 value
    ...

Each changelist needs to be formatted as follow :

Counter. [UE-123456][UE-654321] - Title of the change
    - Description line 1
    - Description line 2
...
